What is it?
----------

A collection of datastructures and other things commonly used in databases, designed to be reusable
such that they can be used as a prototyping and experimentation tool for people curious about the
field.

It also holds a second, and for now equally important purpose, of being an accessible introduction
to many of the concepts in databases.

How done is it?
---------------

Almost not at all. The AVL tree implementation is okay, and the notes on B+ trees are pretty alright
too. That's all there is for now!
